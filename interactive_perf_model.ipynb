Our model predicts that by using 30 cores for the lossless compression, we get the best efficiency, as with this setup the time spent in lossless compression is about the same as the time of the simulation steps and the synchronous lossy compression and the total execution time (red crosses) is the sum of lossless compression on CPUs (green dash-dot line) and communication (yellow dash line) shown in Quadrants I and II.
